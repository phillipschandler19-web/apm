# OpenAPM Mode B (silent-extension) detector.

# Fires when a PR adds substantive net-new code under a normative
# critical path (see critical_paths.txt) without adding any matching
# spec artifact (anchor in the spec body, row in the requirements
# manifest, or new @pytest.mark.req marker). Complements the 4-way
# orphan_check.py, which only catches divergence among ALREADY-
# DECLARED artifacts.
#
# Bypass: add `apm-spec-waiver: <reason, >= 16 chars>` to the PR body
# or a commit message between merge-base and HEAD.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 = no fire (in-scope diff is below threshold, spec-concurrent,
#       out-of-scope, or waived)
#   1 = fire (substantive critical-path add, no spec citation, no
#       waiver)
#   2 = internal error (missing files, git failure)
