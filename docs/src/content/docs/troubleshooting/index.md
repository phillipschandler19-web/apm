## When to escalate

If you're past the relevant page and still stuck, gather these and open an issue:

```bash
apm --version
APM_DEBUG=1 apm <failing-command> --verbose 2>&1 | tee apm-debug.log
apm cache info
```

Attach the log, your `apm.yml`, your `apm.lock.yaml`, and the `apm cache info` output to the [APM issue tracker](https://github.com/microsoft/apm/issues).
