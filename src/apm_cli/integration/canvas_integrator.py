"""Canvas extension integration for APM packages (experimental, Copilot-only).

A *canvas* is a GitHub Copilot CLI extension: a directory bundle whose
entry file is ``extension.mjs`` (executable Node.js) plus optional sibling
assets.  Authors place a canvas under ``.apm/extensions/<name>/`` and
``apm install`` deploys it verbatim to ``.github/extensions/<name>/`` so
Copilot CLI can discover it in the session.

Two independent gates protect this surface:

* The ``canvas`` experimental feature flag turns the primitive ON at all
  (feature availability -- NOT a security gate).
* A trust gate protects against arbitrary executable code: a canvas
  shipped by a *dependency* is blocked by default and requires the
  operator to pass ``--trust-canvas-extensions``.  The author's own
  first-party (root/local) ``.apm/extensions/`` deploys freely once the
  experimental flag is on.

The integrator is Copilot-only.  At **project scope** a canvas deploys to
``.github/extensions/<name>/``.  At **user scope** (``apm install --global``)
a *dependency-provided* canvas deploys to ``~/.copilot/extensions/<name>/`` so
it is available in every Copilot session; the canvas ``PrimitiveMapping`` lives
solely on the ``copilot`` target.  Global canvas install is intentionally
limited for the MVP: only dependency-provided canvases are supported (so the
dependency lockfile tracks them and uninstall can prune them), the operator
must always pass ``--trust-canvas-extensions`` (the blast radius is the whole
account), and only the default ``~/.copilot`` location is honored (a custom
``$COPILOT_HOME`` is refused).
